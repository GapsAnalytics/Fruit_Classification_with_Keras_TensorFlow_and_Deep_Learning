# Fruit Classification with Keras TensorFlow and DeepLearning
Image Classification is a Machine Learning module that trains itself from an existing dataset of multiclass images and develops a model for future prediction of similar images not encountered during training.  It includes code for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
### Installations
We will be using TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, and MatPlotLib to accomplish our goal.
